                    The eradication of poverty is one of the most critical goals set by the United Nations under its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). With people and communities still living in extreme poverty globally, it is crucial for institutions and organizations to contribute to this noble cause. Universities, as centers of knowledge and innovation, play a vital role in addressing this issue and creating sustainable solutions.

                    Cagayan State University recognizes the importance of tackling poverty and has taken several initiatives in order to contribute to this goal, such as financial aid for the less-privileged students and support to communities through engagement and outreach program. Scholarships, grants, and financial aid programs are offered to ensure that no deserving student is deprived of education due to financial constraints. These initiatives aim to empower individuals, uplift communities, and promote sustainable development.
